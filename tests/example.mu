>>Formatting Examples

Text can be formatted as `!bold`! by using the \`! tag, `_underline`_ by using the \`_ tag and `*italic`* by using the \`* tag.

We shall soon see `!bold`! paragraphs of text decorated with `_underlines`_ and `*italics`*. Some even dare `!`*`_combine`` them!

>>Alignment

`cThis line will be centered.
So will this.
`aThe alignment has now been returned to default.
`rThis will be aligned to the right
``

>>Sections

>High Level Stuff
This is a section. It contains this text.

>>Another Level
This is a sub section.

>>>Going deeper
A sub sub section. We could continue, but you get the point.

>>>>
Wait! It's worth noting that we can also create sections without headings. They look like this.
